# Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter, just barely soft
- 1 cup grade A dark amber maple syrup
- 3 eggs - yolks only
- 1/2 Tablespoon vanilla extract
- 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour, divided
- 1/2 cup coconut flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 12 oz chocolate chips
- optional: salt for sprinkling on top

# Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.

2. If your butter is cold out of the fridge, then heat it in a microwave safe bowl at 50% power for 20 seconds. It should be soft enough to mix, but not melted. Use a mixer to mix together the butter and maple syrup. Mix in the egg yolks and vanilla.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix or stir into the wet ingredients using a fork. Once combined, refrigerate the cookie dough for 20 minutes. (Don't skip this step--you're giving the whole wheat and coconut flours time to absorb the excess liquid from the maple syrup.)

4. Remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator, stir in the remaining 1 cup whole wheat flour and chocolate chips. (See Notes regarding chocolate chips.)

5. Scoop 2-3 tablespoons of dough and form into mounds on a non-stick baking sheet. (Or use your handy-dandy cookie scoop.) Bake for 10-11 minutes, until the edges are starting to turn dark brown. We tried the 8 minutes cookies and all agreed the 10 minute cookies were superior! (Refrigerate remaining dough between batches.) Remove the cookies from the oven and immediately use a spatula to gently move the cookies to a cooling rack. Enjoy!

6. Store cookies in an airtight container on the counter.

# Notes

Chocolate Chips: If you want traditional chocolate, but are trying to avoid refined sugar, choose the darkest chocolate you enjoy. If you want to cut out refined sugar entirely, consider using Enjoy Life or Davis chocolate chips.
