Ingredients

- 1 (8 oz) can tomato sauce
- 1 (6 oz) can tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2-3 tablespoons honey
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons finely grated parmesan cheese
- crushed red peppers to taste

Instructions

1. Add all ingredients to a small saucepan and whisk over medium-low heat, until heated through! Adjust the honey based on how sweet you like your pizza sauce. 2 Tablespoons will yield a traditional pizzeria-style sauce, whereas 3 tablespoons is sweeter and great for margherita pizzas!

2. Freeze any sauce you are not using immediately in a sealed mason jar or zip-top plastic bag for up to a month. When ready to use, remove to the refrigerator 24 hours in advance or place in hot water, exchanging the water as necessary.
