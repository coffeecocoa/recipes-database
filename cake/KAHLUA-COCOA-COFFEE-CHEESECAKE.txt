Kahlua coffee cheesecake swirled with chocolate coffee cheesecake in an oreo crust!

# Ingredients

Crust:

- 18 whole oreos (not double-stuffed)
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted 

Filling:

- 28 oz full-fat cream cheese (3 1/2 8-oz packages), at room temperature
- 1 cup white granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup full fat sour cream, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 3 oz semi-sweet chocolate bar, melted
- 3 tablespoons instant espresso powder
- 2 tablespoons kahlua

Chocolate Ganache (optional):
- 8 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup heavy cream

# Instructions

1. Remove your ingredients from the fridge and allow them to come to room temperature. Make sure the top rack in your oven is in the middle position. Place the bottom rack just below the top rack, leaving enough space to place a sheet pan on the bottom rack.

2. Make the Crust! Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Pulse the oreos in a food processor until nothing more than fine crumbs. Add the melted butter and pulse until the mixture clumps together and all the crumbs are moistened. Press the crumbs into a 9" springform pan, coming just about 3/4" up the sides. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from oven and set aside to cool. (Leave the oven at 350 degrees.)

3. Prepare the insulated pan strip to help with getting a flat, crack-free cheesecake.

4. Prepare the Flavors! In one medium-sized bowl, stir 2 tablespoons espresso powder into 2 tablespoons kahlua and let sit a couple minutes. Then add 4 oz (1/2 package) cream cheese to the espresso kahlua and whisk or hand mix until smooth. In a second medium-sized bowl, melt the 3 oz semi-sweet chocolate bar and stir together with 1 tablespoon espresso powder. Set aside.

5. Prepare the Filling! Using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat 24 oz of cream cheese (or three 8-oz packages) and sugar together until smooth. (3-4 minutes.) Add the sour cream and vanilla and beat until thoroughly mixed and there are no lumps.

6. Pause the filling for a minute to prepare your steam bath. Place a baking sheet on the bottom rack of the preheated oven and carefully(!) pour tap water into the pan until at least 1/4"-1/2" deep. Close the oven and let it come back up to temperature. Wrap your insulating strips around the outside of your springform pan and twist the two ends together like a twist-tie. Set aside.

7. Back to the filling! Add the first egg and beat on low only until the yellow of the yolk has JUST disappeared. Add the second egg and beat on low only until the yellow of the yolk has JUST disappeared. (Over-mixing will increase the chance of cracks!) Add the third egg and beat on low only until the yellow of the yolk has JUST disappeared. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides. Then beat on low just 5 or so seconds longer to be sure the egg has been fully incorporated.

8. Swirl! Remove about one third of the batter (about 2-3 cups) and add to the medium-sized bowl with the melted espresso chocolate. Use a spatula to fold the batter for 10-15 seconds until combined. Grab the second medium-sized bowl with the kahlua-espresso cream cheese mixture and add to the remaining two thirds of the batter. Whisk on low for 30 seconds until smooth. Use a spatula to fold the mixture to press out any air bubbles. Add the kahlua-espresso filling to your prepared oreo crust. Then, using a spoon or spatula, drop dollops of the chocolate filling all over the kahlua filling. Use a butter knife or skewer to swirl the batters together, being careful not to disturb the oreo crust.

9. Bake! Place the cheesecake on the top rack of the preheated oven, above the steam bath, and bake for 50-55 minutes. Do NOT open the oven to avoid temperature changes. I usually grab the handle of my oven door and give my oven a shake. The cheesecake is done when the outer 1"-2" of your cheesecake is set but the middle 3"-4" of your cheesecake still wobbles a little bit. At this point, turn off the oven. Open your oven door no more than 1"-2" to let heat SLOWLY escape. The idea is to bring your cheesecake oh-so-slowly back to room temperature. Any sudden temperature changes could shock the cheesecake and cause it to crack. So will over-baking. (Have no fear - the cheesecake will cook and set a little more as it cools. If in doubt as to whether it's done, and you're stricken with indecision, turn the oven off, but wait 3-5 minutes to open the door.)

10. Once the oven has cooled down and is only slightly warmer than the room (at least one hour), remove the cheesecake and let it come to room temperature. Remove the insulating wrap, cover with foil, and place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours. (I prefer to make it a day in advance.)

11. If serving with chocolate ganache, heat the heavy cream until just starting to bubble and pour over the chocolate chips in a bowl. Let sit three minutes and then stir until smooth! Slice the cheesecake and serve!
