# Ingredients

- 1 medium head cauliflower, steamed
- 3 Tbsp ghee, or grass-fed butter
- 1/2 cup yellow onion, chopped

- 2 tsp stone ground mustard, or cider vinegar

# Instructions

1. Steam the cauliflower in boiling water or using a steamer inserted into your saucepan and steam for 8 minutes, or until tender when poked with a fork. Drain and set aside until ready to use.

2. Heat the ghee over medium-high to a skillet and add the onion. Saute, stirring occasionally until onion begins turning golden-brown, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and continue sauteeing another 2 minutes.

3. Transfer the steamed cauliflower, sauteed onion and garlic, broth, mustard and sea salt to a high-powered blender and blend until creamy.

4. Taste sauce for flavor and add sea salt to taste.

5. Use anywhere you would use a cream-based sauce.
