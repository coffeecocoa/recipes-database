# Ingredients

- 2 pints cherry tomatoes
- 1/3 cup avocado oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ tsp sea salt
- ¼ tsp fresh cracked black pepper
- 8 ounce block feta cheese
- 1 Tbsp dried oregano
- 8 ounces gluten-free pasta
- ¼ cup fresh basil, chopped, or more to taste
- 1/4 cup pesto sauce

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

2. Transfer the cherry tomatoes to a 9-inch or larger casserole dish, and toss them in a couple tablespoons of the avocado oil. Stir in the dried oregano and minced garlic.

3. Place the block of feta cheese on top of the tomatoes and sprinkle everything with sea salt and pepper. Pour the rest of the avocado oil over everything (note: be sure to pour it over the feta to ensure the feta doesn’t burn while baking).

4. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the tomatoes are very juicy and have burst open.

5. While the tomatoes and feta are baking, cook the pasta noodles. Once cooked, strain them and set aside until ready to use.

6. Remove the tomatoes and feta from the oven and use a fork or spoon to mash and stir the feta and tomatoes together, forming a chunky sauce.

7. Pour the cooked pasta noodles into the casserole dish with the sauce, along with the fresh basil and pesto sauce. Stir everything together until well-combined. Taste the pasta for flavor and add more sea salt and/or pepper to taste.

8. Serve and enjoy!
