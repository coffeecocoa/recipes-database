Ingredients

- 2 lbs Rib eye steak
- 2 tbsp Butter
- Salt and pepper to taste

Italian Salsa Verde:

- 1 cup Flat-leaf parsley, stems removed
- 3 Garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1 tsp Black pepper
- 2 tbsp Capers, drained
- 2 Anchovy fillets minced
- 1/2 cup Extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp Red wine vinegar
- ¼ tsp Red pepper flakes
- 1 tsp Lemon zest
- 2 tbsp Lemon juice

Method

1. Preheat grill to high heat.

2. Place steaks on a cutting board and season with salt and pepper on all sides.

3. Place the seasoned steaks on the hot grill, and cook for 5-6 minutes on each side for medium-rare (1-inch steak) or 6-8 minutes on each side for a 1½ inch steak.

4. For a perfect medium rare, your instant read meat thermometer should read 135°F.

5. Remove steaks from the grill, top with butter and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

6. While steaks are resting, make the salsa verde. In a small food processor pulse the parsley, garlic cloves, salt, pepper, capers and anchovies until combined, but still able to see the ingredients clearly (slightly chunky). Add the parsley mixture to a small bowl and add the olive oil, red wine vinegar, red pepper flakes, lemon juice and lemon zest. Stir until combined.

7. Slice the steak against the grain and serve with salsa verde.
