# Ingredients

- 1/3 cup avocado oil
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar, or cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup coconut aminos, or liquid aminos
- 2 cups fresh basil
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 Tbsp pure maple syrup
- 1/2 tsp sea salt

# Instructions

1. Add all of the ingredients to a small blender (I use my Magic Bullet) and blend until combined. Itâ€™s fine to leave the basil slightly chunky (I do). Store in an air-tight container for up to 4 days, or use immediately to marinate any animal protein.
