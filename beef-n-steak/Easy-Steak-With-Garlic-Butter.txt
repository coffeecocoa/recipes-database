# Ingredients

- 3-12 ounce rib-eye steaks , 1 1/4-inch-thick*
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper , to taste

For the Garlic Butter:

- 1/2 cup unsalted butter , at room temperature
- 3 cloves garlic , minced (especially wonderful if you use roasted garlic)
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

# Instructions

1. To make the garlic steak butter, combine butter, garlic, salt, and pepper. Transfer the mixture to parchment paper; shape into a log. Roll in parchment to 1 1/2 inches in diameter, twisting the ends to close. Refrigerate until ready to use, up to 1 week.

2. Preheat oven to broil. Place an oven-proof skillet, we prefer to use our Lodge Cast Iron Skillet, in the oven.

3. Using paper towels, pat both sides of the steak dry. This is essential to get a nice caramelization on the steak. Drizzle with olive oil; season with salt and pepper evenly to taste.

4. Remove the skillet from the oven and heat over medium-high heat on the stovetop.

5. Once the pan is hot, place the steak in the middle of the skillet and cook until a dark crust has formed, about 1 minute. Using tongs, flip, and cook for an additional 60 seconds.

6. Remove the skillet from the stove.

7. Place your skillet into the oven and cook until desired doneness is reached, about 4-5 minutes for medium-rare, flipping once. Let rest for 3-5 minutes, tented, not wrapped with foil.

8. Serve immediately with a slice of garlic butter.

#Notes

* Steaks can be tricky to buy. The ribeye is one of the most flavorful cuts of steak, however a filet, New York or T-bone would work as well.

To reheat,  place leftover steaks on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and warm them on the middle rack of a 250-degree oven for about 30 minutes.
