# Ingredients

- 15 oz tomato sauce
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 teaspoons ground mustard
- 1/4 cup honey (vegan: maple syrup)
- 1 Tablespoon maple syrup (I use grade A dark)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 Tablespoon coconut flour

# Instructions

1. Add all ingredients except the coconut flour to a medium-sized saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat until simmering. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Whisk coconut flour into the mixture and simmer for an additional 5 minutes.

2. Adjust for Taste: If you want it a bit sweeter, add an extra Tablespoon of honey. If you want it more spicy, add a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne powder.

3. Remove BBQ sauce from heat and allow it to cool. Store in a mason jar in the refrigerator. Use it with chicken or pork on burger buns. Or serve with roasted sweet potatoes, chicken nuggets, and/or french fries!
